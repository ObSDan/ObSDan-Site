Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am Daniel Cleaton and I am going to use this blog primarily as a way of documenting my own research into deep learning (and later, into more general machine learning and dev diaries for the cool little projects I hope to make with all this knowledge). I am currently learning how to use the **Fast.ai** framework with **PyTorch** in order to figure out deep learning, play around with some new skills, and generally have some fun along the way.

*You can read more about me and the tools I use in About Me at the top of this page.*

Thanks to [Fast.ai's fantastic guide](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) I have created this new GitHub Pages site, so I can take the same tools I now use for doing my deep learning and make them do double duty as my blog-authoring software also. In this way, I hope to have posts showing the behind-the-scenes detail of the work I am doing and the actual results I am getting at the time.

Okay, welcomes/thanks/advertisments out of the way, it's on with the blog...
